[Sword Slash] Swing your sword, hitting all enemies in an arc for {s1}-{s1.1} physical slash damage. Hitting at least 1 enemy starts a combo while missing or waiting for 2 seconds resets it.

Consumes counter-attack buff to skip to the 3rd strike of the combo. Fortify reduces damage taken by 30%. Each point in Blade Mastery increases fortify's damage reduction by 2%.
[Guard] Raise your shield, causing damage from hits to be absorbed by your guard meter. Can be held indefinitely. Blocking a hit grants counter-attack buff for 1 second upon lowering your shield. Counter attack buff grants {h0.15+a0.1+r0.1} strength and {h0.15} intelligence which decays to 50% over 1 second. Each point in Shield Mastery reduces damage taken while defending by 3%.
[Arrow Shot] Draw back an arrow for up to 1 second. Can be fired early by releasing the mouse button, but the arrow doesn't travel as far or do as much damage.

[Stances] Autofire: automatically fires at maximum charge. Aimed shot: doesn't fire until released. Piercing shot: arrow pierces enemies but takes twice as long to charge.
[Bubble] Rapidly fires bubbles with randomized spread and duration. Bubbles pop upon hitting an enemy or expiring, {i0.15}-{i0.45} magic water damage, increased by up to 100% based on travel distance, and have a 6% (-2% per existing pool, minimum of 2%) chance of leaving a pool for 8 seconds which restores 6 mana and {h0.025+i0.05} health per second, increased by up to 50% based on the distance the bubble had travelled, while in contact with you. Deals magic damage. Each point in Rod Mastery reduces mana cost and spread by 5%. [Aqua Sphere] Envelop yourself in a sphere of water while accelerating forward until released, then the sphere explodes. Drains 9 mana/sec. Reduces damage taken from all sources by {h0.075+i0.15}. Sphere explodes pre-maturely if you run out of mana or if the sphere fails to negate an instance of damage entirely. If charged for long enough, an explosion is triggered, knocking nearby enemies and projectiles away and dealing up to {i3.5}-{i3.85} magic impact-water damage (based on charge time).
[Crossbow Shot] Fires long ranged bolts. Does not inhibit movement, allowing you to strafe. Deals {s0.8}-{s0.95} physical pierce damage to the first enemy hit. Each point in Ranged Mastery reduces attack time by 4%. [Stances] Single shot: normal stance. Multishot: Fires 3 bolts at once, but damage is reduced to {s0.325}-{s0.375}. These bolts gain 2% damage per frame for the first half of their travel.
[Decimate] After a brief delay, swings your axe in a circle, hitting all enemies around you. Enemies hit by the blade take {s1.9}-{s2} physical slash damage and heal you for 12% of your missing health (up to 36% missing heal per swing) while those hit by the handle only take {s0.65}-{s0.7} physical impact damage. Each point in Blade Mastery reduces damage taken by 3% during usage. [Crippling Strike] Swing your axe, hitting a single enemy for {s1.75}-{s1.9} physical slash damage and briefly staggering its actions. If the target dies, the mana cost is refunded. Each point in Blade Mastery adds {h0.03} physical damage.
[Mace of Spades] Costs health to activate. Swings your mace, hitting up to 2 enemies, dealing {s0.65}-{s0.7} physical and {i0.85}-{i0.9} magic impact damage. May be used 2 more times for free. First recast has the same effects, but the last one hits ALL enemies in an increased area, dealing twice as much magic damage. 25% of the magic damage dealt is gained as shielding using Iron Man (each enemy hit beyond the first generates 1/2 shield). Each point in Rod Mastery increases its area of effect by 10%.
