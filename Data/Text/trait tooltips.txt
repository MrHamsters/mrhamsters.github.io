Darkness Rise
[Passive] After landing 3 times with Obliterate (Nightfall), gain an aura which increases your movement speed by 10% and deals {i0.4} (plus {i0.15+h0.05}, up to 15% of the enemy's maximum health) magic void damage per second to nearby enemies (50% resistance penetration, generates 50% more shield for Indestructible Revenant). Aura lasts for 4 seconds, refreshed upon landing Obliterate again.
Indestructible Revenant
[Passive] Stores 5% of damage dealt and 40% of damage taken (after all absorbtion effects) as a potential shield, up to {i2+h1.5} (decays when out of combat). [Active] Activates the stored shield, plus {i0.1+h0.075}, allowing it to absorb incoming damage (prevents damage from being taken). After 1 second, it begins to decay at an accelerating rate, but re-casting Indestructible Revenant will consume the remaining shield, healing you for 40% of its value. 5 second cooldown after the shield becomes inactive. Can be used mid-action.
